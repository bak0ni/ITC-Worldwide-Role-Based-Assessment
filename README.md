# ITC-Worldwide-Role-Based-Assessment
ITC Worldwide Role Based Assessment for Zero Trust Multi-Domain Network Security Omni-Architecture &amp; Environment

Technical Scope:
1. Multi-Domain, Multi-Geo, and Multi-Project Setup:

Clustered Domain Architecture:
o 12 clustered domains spanning multiple development environments.
o Secure isolation of development groups within each domain.

Multi-Geographical Deployment:
o Locations: France, Italy, Nigeria etc.
o Within each region, multiple development teams operate, categorized by:

Python Development Group

.NET Development Group

Game Development Group

Additional specialized teams
o Each development group comprises:

Developers, Contributors, Program Administrators, Project Managers etc.

Project Management & Resource Alignment:
o Archive of documentation, task management, and resource allocation.
o Multi-project support with dynamically provisioned resources.
2. Secure Virtual Development Environment:

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Provisioning:
o Dynamic VDI provisioning per project requirements.
o VDI Isolation: Every project has its own dedicated VDI instance aligned with
project needs and security groups.
o VDI User Segmentation:

Group-based access: Project team members interact based on assigned
roles.

Subset-based access: Specialized teams (e.g., Data Integration, Analytics)
operate within restricted environments.

DevOps Task Management Integration:
o Responsibility-driven DevOps work assignment within secure network policies.
3. Network Security & Access Control:

Zero Trust Security Model Implementation:
o Identity-based access control (MFA enforced for all users).
o Strict endpoint security policies.
o Per-user dedicated VPN with role-based access restrictions.

Automated Deployment & Security Compliance:
o Deployment must be fully automated using either of the following:

Logic Apps

PowerShell

Bash Scripting or any you are comfortable with.
o Deployment and Termination Policies:

Automated provisioning and deprovisioning of VDIs.

Session-based VDI lifecycle:

VDIs are active only during billable work hours (e.g., 7 AM – 4
PM).

At 3 PM, users receive a one-hour warning before automatic
shutdown.

Automated backup execution during the last 15 minutes before
shutdown.

Immutable snapshot storage in cold storage post-session.
4. Resource & Cost Optimization:

Scheduled Resource Decommissioning:
o Full Azure resource termination at session end (not just VM shutdown but
complete deallocation including IPs).

Infrastructure & Security Flow Design:
o Full network layout and security architecture based on Zero Trust principles.

Deployment and Shutdown Sequences:
o Ensuring systematic, clock-driven execution without overruns or weekend
resource wastage.
Assessment Deliverables:
Candidates are required to present a comprehensive documentation and implementation
strategy, including:
1. Detailed Deployment Strategy:
o End-to-end infrastructure provisioning plan.
2. Automated Backup and Resource Shutdown Plan:
o Cold storage snapshotting.
o Scheduled deallocation of all project resources.
3. Zero Trust Architecture Implementation:
o Secure VPN access, MFA policies, and endpoint security.
4. Technical Diagrams & Documentation:
o Network & Security Architecture:

Developed using Draw.io, Visio, or equivalent tools.
o Deployment Flow & Lifecycle Documentation:

Suggested format: Spreadsheet or structured documentation.
o Script Samples for Automation:

Written in PowerShell, Python, Bash, or Logic Apps.
5. Test Environment Demonstration (Optional but Preferred):
o A proof-of-concept environment demonstrating compliance with security and
automation policies.
o Implementation in Azure, Power Platform, or any DevOps-enabled
environment.
Key Evaluation Criteria:

Security Compliance: Alignment with Zero Trust Architecture & endpoint security
best practices.

Infrastructure Optimization: Efficient VDI provisioning and cost-controlled
resource management.

Automation & DevOps Maturity: Fully automated deployment and shutdown
workflows.

Technical Documentation & Clarity: Comprehensive architectural design and
workflow documentation.

Practical Implementation & Feasibility: Feasibility of proposed solutions in a real-
world enterprise scenario.
